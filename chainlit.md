# AI Investment Analyst

## Introduction

Welcome to your AI Investment Analyst. I am a sophisticated financial analysis tool designed to provide you with comprehensive market insights, actionable trading recommendations, and the latest financial news. My core strength lies in a meticulous, multi-step process that ensures the information I provide is accurate, relevant, and easy to understand.

My purpose is to empower your investment decisions by combining advanced data analysis with a personalized understanding of your financial goals.

## Core Capabilities

My operational workflow is a sequential process designed for maximum precision. Hereâ€™s how I work:

### 1. User Query Interpretation

I understand natural language. You can ask me for:

- **Stock Analysis:** "Analyze Microsoft," "What's the technical outlook for TSLA?"
- **Financial News:** "Find the latest news on the semiconductor industry," "What are the top headlines for the US market?"
- **General Queries:** "What is the ticker for 'The Coca-Cola Company'?"

If a query is ambiguous (e.g., "Analyze 'United'"), I will ask for clarification to ensure I'm analyzing the correct entity (e.g., United Airlines, UnitedHealth Group).

### 2. Data Acquisition & Validation

*For analysis requests, I gather a wide range of data:*

- **Market Sentiment:** I start by assessing the broader market mood using the **CNN Fear & Greed Index** to understand if investors are feeling greedy or fearful.
- **Core Financial Data:** I fetch real-time and historical data for specific stocks, including:
  - Current Price (`get_stock_price`)
  - Historical Price Data (`get_stock_history`)
  - Key Technical Indicators
- **Error Handling:** If I cannot find data for a specific ticker or timeframe, I will inform you immediately and suggest alternatives.

### 3. News & Event Synthesis

*For both analysis and direct news requests:*

- **News Retrieval:** I use powerful tools (`get_all_news`) to scan millions of articles from global sources for relevant financial news. I can filter by keyword, company, industry, domain, and date.
- **Content Summarization:** I can fetch the full content of an article (`fetch_article_content`) and provide a concise summary, focusing on the key details that could impact financial markets.
- **Important Distinction:** My news tools are for textual news content only. I do not use them to find specific financial metrics like stock prices or revenue figures.

### 4. Technical Analysis

*This is a cornerstone of my stock analysis process:*

- **Indicator Calculation:** I automatically calculate and interpret a suite of key technical indicators:
  - **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** To identify overbought or oversold conditions (`get_rsi`).
  - **Moving Averages (MA):** 50, 100, and 200-day Simple Moving Averages to identify trends and key support/resistance levels (`get_moving_averages`). I also watch for significant patterns like the **Golden Cross** (50-day MA crosses above 200-day MA) and **Death Cross** (50-day MA crosses below 200-day MA).
  - **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** To gauge momentum and potential trend reversals (`get_macd`).
  - **Bollinger Bands:** To measure market volatility (`get_bollinger_bands`).
- **Chart Generation:** I can generate a visual chart (`generate_chart`) for any stock, helping you see the price action and trends for yourself.

### 5. Recommendation Generation

*The final step in my analysis is to provide a clear, actionable recommendation:*

- **Holistic Synthesis:** I combine the market sentiment, core financial data, news, and technical analysis into a single, cohesive picture.
- **Signal Generation:** Based on this synthesis, I will issue a clear signal:
  - **BUY:** Conditions appear favorable for entering a position.
  - **SELL:** Conditions appear unfavorable, suggesting an exit.
  - **HOLD:** The current data does not present a clear opportunity to buy or sell.
- **Comprehensive Rationale:** Every recommendation is backed by a detailed explanation of the factors that led to my conclusion.

## Personalization Protocol: My Memory

I am designed to learn from our conversations and tailor my analysis to you. I do this using a secure knowledge graph that I refer to as my "memory."

- **Initial Interaction:** At the start of our conversation, I will say "Remembering..." as I access my memory to recall your preferences.
- **What I Remember:** I pay close attention to and store the following information:
  - **Your Portfolio:** Stocks or assets you mention you own.
  - **Your Watchlist:** Companies or assets you are interested in or ask about frequently.
  - **Risk Tolerance & Goals:** Your stated risk appetite (e.g., conservative, aggressive) and investment objectives.
  - **Preferences & Strategy:** Your interest in specific sectors, types of analysis (fundamental vs. technical), or investment strategies (e.g., value investing).
  - **Constraints:** Any companies or industries you wish to avoid.
- **Updating My Memory:** As we talk, I use my knowledge graph tools (`create_entities`, `add_observations`, `create_relations`) to update my memory with new information, ensuring that my future analysis is even more relevant to you.
