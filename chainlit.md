# Advanced AI Investment Analyst and Trading Executive: README

## Introduction

As an Advanced AI Investment Analyst and Trading Executive, my core mission is multifaceted: to deliver comprehensive financial analysis, actionable trading recommendations, and highly relevant financial news; to **execute trades and manage portfolio queries on behalf of the user when explicitly instructed**; and to automate and schedule financial reporting tasks. I operate with precision, synthesizing complex data into clear insights, executing financial operations, and managing tasks using a robust suite of analytical, transactional, and scheduling tools. This document outlines my capabilities, workflow, and the tools I use to provide you with market intelligence and portfolio management.

***

### Core Capabilities

* **Comprehensive Stock Analysis**: I can perform in-depth analysis of individual stocks or companies. Just provide a ticker symbol (e.g., `AAPL`) or a company name (e.g., `Apple Inc.`).
* **Stock Comparison**: I can compare two stocks to help you make informed decisions (e.g., "Compare GOOGL and MSFT").
* **Financial News Synthesis**: I can fetch, summarize, and analyze the latest financial news relevant to specific companies, industries, or the market as a whole.
* **Actionable Recommendations**: Based on a holistic analysis, I generate clear **Buy**, **Sell**, or **Hold** recommendations, supported by a detailed rationale.
* **Trade Execution & Portfolio Management**: I can place, cancel, and manage orders, as well as provide summaries of your account and portfolio holdings upon your direct instruction.
* **Scheduling & Task Automation**: I can schedule tasks and reminders for the future. For example, you can ask me to "provide a market summary tomorrow at 9 AM" or "remind me to check on my GOOGL position in 3 hours."
* **Email Reporting**: I can send the results of my analysis or other content directly to an email address, either immediately or at a scheduled time.

***

### Analytical Workflow

For analysis requests, I follow a structured, multi-step process to ensure every analysis is thorough and well-rounded.

#### 1. User Interaction & Query Interpretation

My first step is to understand your request accurately.

* **Ticker Identification**: If you provide a company name, I use the `get_ticker` tool to find the correct stock symbol.
* **Clarification**: If a company name is ambiguous or has multiple listings, I will ask for more information to ensure accuracy.
* **News-Only Requests**: For requests purely about news, I will directly proceed to the News & Event Synthesis step.

#### 2. Data Acquisition & Validation

I gather a wide range of data points from various sources to build a complete picture.

* **Broad Overview**: `comprehensive_ticker_report`
* **Core Financials**: `get_stock_price`, `get_price_history`
* **Market Sentiment**: `get_current_fng_tool`, `get_historical_fng_tool`, `analyze_fng_trend`
* **Ownership & Derivatives**: `get_institutional_holders`, `get_insider_trades`, `get_options`
* **Earnings Data**: `get_earnings_calendar`

#### 3. Financial Report Analysis

I dive deep into a company's financial health.

* **Financial Statements**: `get_financial_statements` (Income, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow)
* **Earnings Performance**: `get_earnings_history` to analyze past performance and future estimates.
* **Key Metrics**: I highlight trends in Revenue, Net Income, EPS, P/E Ratio, and Debt-to-Equity.

#### 4. Technical Analysis

I analyze price and volume data to identify market trends and patterns.

* **Indicator Calculation**: `calculate_technical_indicator` for custom computations.
* **Specific Indicators**:
  * `get_moving_averages` (e.g., 50, 100, 200-day)
  * `get_rsi` (Relative Strength Index)
  * `get_macd` (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  * `get_bollinger_bands`
  * `get_volatility_analysis`
  * `get_support_resistance` levels
  * `get_trend_analysis`
* **Summary**: I use `get_technical_summary` for a quick overview of key technical signals.

#### 5. News & Event Synthesis

I stay on top of the latest events that could impact your investments.

* **News Aggregation**: `get_all_news` to search millions of articles from various sources.
* **Content Analysis**: I summarize the most impactful news and explain its financial implications.

#### 6. Recommendation Generation

This is the culmination of my analysis. I synthesize all the data from the previous steps to provide a clear, actionable trading signal (**Buy**, **Sell**, or **Hold**) with a robust, evidence-based rationale.

### Trading & Account Management

For direct action requests, I bypass the analytical workflow and use transactional tools to manage your portfolio.

* **Intent Confirmation**: Before executing any trade, I will confirm the parameters of your request (e.g., quantity, price, order type) to ensure accuracy.
* **Order Placement**: I can execute various order types based on your instructions:
  * `place_market_order`
  * `place_limit_order`
  * `place_stop_order`
  * `place_stop_limit_order`
* **Position & Order Management**:
  * `close_position`: To liquidate an existing holding.
  * `cancel_order`: To cancel a pending order.
* **Account Information**:
  * `get_account_info_tool`: For details on your account balance and status.
  * `get_portfolio_summary`: For a complete overview of your current holdings.

***

### Scheduling, Reminders, & Reporting

I can automate tasks and deliver information at a time that suits you.

* **Time-Based Triggers**: Using `get_current_time` and `calculate_relative_time`, I can understand requests like "in 5 hours" or "tomorrow at 10 AM EST."
* **Task Scheduling**: With `schedule_task_tool`, I can set a reminder or schedule a complex task for a future time.
* **Task Management**: You can view all pending tasks with `list_scheduled_tasks` and cancel any with `cancel_scheduled_task`.
* **Email Delivery**: I can use `send_markdown_email` to send reports, analysis, or news summaries to a specified email address, either instantly or as part of a scheduled task.

***

### Output Format

For **analysis requests**, my findings are delivered in a structured markdown format for clarity. For trading or account management requests, the response will be a direct confirmation of the action taken.
